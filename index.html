            a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave
            out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes
            always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could
            tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of
            the cobbles.

            who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be
            keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who
            could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on
            boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
